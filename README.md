## My Main Thoughts:
* I realize the scope of your project is entirely based on quality and availibity of incoming data (API)
* Leading up to this point, I feel very confident with fundamentals of Node and it's intersting to see my regularily visited sites from a whole new perspective.
* Beyond strech goals - I can see this project continue to grow as my interest in crypto remains same.  Some crazy goals I that comes to mind:
    * add public wallet address instead of static entry of your coin value to reflect your actual holdings
    * api trading from your exchange of choice from '/trading' route.
    * app access to link your exchange data
