## My Main Thoughts:
* I realize the scope of your project is entirely based on quality and availibity of incoming data (API)
* From this project, I feel very confident with the fundamentals of Node.  It's interesting to see all the sites I normally visit... I now see it from a new perspective.
* Beyond strech goals - I can see this project continue to grow inline with my crypto interests.  Some crazy goals that comes to mind:
    * add public wallet address instead of static entry of your coin value to reflect your actual holdings
    * api trading from your exchange of choice from '/trading' route.
    * app access to link your exchange data
